# GraphReduce

GraphReduce is a web application built in p5.js to visualize a graph reduction process to help find a maximum sub-clique of a graph. I also added an NP solution alogrithm to find the largest sub-clique within the given graph.

## Getting Started

The input file is required to contain edge descriptions of integers with no blank line at the end.

## Closing

I created the reduction algorithm without any research into graph reduction algorithms. Any commonalities between my algortihm and a well known algorithm is just happenstance.
