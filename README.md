GraphReduce is a web application used to visualize a graph reduction process to help find a maximum sub-clique of a graph.

## Getting Started

The input file is required to contain edge descriptions of integers with no blank line at the end.

## Closing

I created this algorithm without any research into graph reduction algorithms. Any commonalities between my algortihm and a well known algorithm is just happenstance.
